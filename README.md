# :dragon: Release the Dragon :dragon:

# Hi! 
This is a two-people two-days project was about learning React! We didn't really know anything about it before starting the project, and now we know a little bit more. One more team chose to code Snake, so we decided to call ours Dragon.

At the moment the dragon only crawls on the grid and dies if he hits the borders of it, starting again from its initial position.

We have forked the repo to our personal GitHubs because we liked the result so much that we definitely would like to develop it for longer and make it a nice product, alongside getting more confident with React.

## To run our Dragon:

1. ```git clone``` our staging branch

2. ```npm i``` 

3. ```npm run dev```

4. go to ```localhost:1234```


## To steer our Dragon:

1. Press the start button 

2. Steer by pressing the arrow keys 


## Features to be added (hopefully) soon!

- [ ] Refactor and modularise code (high priority);

- [ ] Create an apple-shaped cell to feed the dragon;

- [ ] We also wanted to make the dragon grow when the head of it was at the same position as the randomized apple cell;

- [ ] Lower the interval time when the dragon eats an apple;

- [ ] Serve a "Game Over" div when the dragon hits the walls;
