# react-dragon

# Hi! 

## To run our Dragon:

1. git clone (!FROM STAGING!)

2. npm i 

3. npm run dev

4. go to localhost:1234


## To steer our Dragon:

1. Press the start button 

2. Steer by pressing the arrow keys 


## Choices, choices 

### Why

This project was about learning React! We didn't really know anything about it before starting the project, and now we know a little bit more. 


### How 

We got help with how to make a grid from the internetz, and then we put an event listener on the window to pick up the arrow keypresses. We successfully made the dragon move with the responding arrow keypresses, which we're quite happy about, but as of now, that's kind of it. 

## S T R E T C H  G O A L S 

- We wanted to randomize apple cells that pops up in the grid at a set interval

- We also wanted to make the dragon grow when the head of it was at the same position as the randomized apple cell

- Lower the interval time when the dragon eats an apple 

- Serve a "Game Over" div when the dragon hits the walls
